Shared Reference completed.  Reduce register pressure?  Changed upTriangle to
use tididx instead of tid.  Look at convo with Kyle again in the morning to see
what plots exactly were expected.  Ask MIT for data or run myself?  Change source code output?
Wouldn't be incredibly difficult in KS.  Then tell him and start writing maybe or plot CPU data?

Run yourself
Get mpinum procs max 1,2,4,6,8,10,12 -> max procs.
But use numspatialpoints as base.
