# Result Folders
* _SimResults_: Plots of the simulation results at a few points in the simulation.
* _Gifs_: Gifs of the results of all the schemes.  See how the KS equation falls into chaos and how the shockwave propagates through the tube!
* _performance_: Performance plot for each problem, precision, and algorithm with curves for at all tested blocksizes.
    * _Summary_:  Html tables of best runs.  Plots of relevant and informative data from performance tests.
* _ExactTesting_: Error plots and consistency test results for all problems evaluated at Double precision.
* _ConferencePaper_: Data and plots from the state of the project as presented to AIAA SciTech 2017.
